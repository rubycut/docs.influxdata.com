Literals
--------

### Booleans

Boolean literals are the keywords `TRUE` and `FALSE`.
They are case sensitive.

### Numbers

Numbers are typed and are either a `float64` or an `int64`.
If the number contains a decimal it is considered to be a `float64` otherwise it is an `int64`.
All numbers are considered to be base 10 numbers.

Valid number literals:

* 1 -- int64
* 1.2 -- float64
* 5 -- int64
* 5.0 -- float64
* 0.42 -- float64

Invalid number literals:

* .1 -- decimals must have a leading zero

### Strings

There are two ways to write string literals:

1.
Single quoted strings with backslash escaped single quotes.

    This string `'single \' quoted'` becomes the literal `single ' quoted`.

2.
Triple single quoted strings with no escaping.

    This string `'''triple \' quoted'''` becomes the literal `triple \' quoted`.

### Durations

TICKscript supports durations literals.
They are of the form of an InfluxQL duration literals.
See https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/query_language/spec.html#literals

Duration literals specify a length of time.
An integer literal followed immediately (with no spaces) by a duration unit listed below is interpreted as a duration literal.

#### Duration unit definitions

 Units  | Meaning
--------|-----------------------------------------
 u or Âµ | microseconds (1 millionth of a second)
 ms     | milliseconds (1 thousandth of a second)
 s      | second
 m      | minute
 h      | hour
 d      | day
 w      | week

Statements
----------

A statement begins with an identifier and any number of chaining function calls.
The result of a statement can be assigned to a variable using the `var` keyword and assignment operator `=`.

Example:

```javascript
    var errors = stream.from().measurement('errors')
    var requests = stream.from().measurement('requests')
    // Join the errors and requests stream
    errors.join(requests)
            .as('errors', 'requests')
        .eval(lambda: "errors.value" / "requests.value")
```

Format
------

### Whitespace

Whitespace is ignored and can be used to format the code as you like.

Typically property methods are indented in from their calling node.
This way methods along the left edge are chaining methods.

For example:

```javascript
stream
   .eval(lambda: "views" + "errors")
       .as('total_views') // Increase indent for property method.
.httpOut('example') // Decrease indent for chaining method.
```

### Comments

 Basic `//` style single line comments are supported.
